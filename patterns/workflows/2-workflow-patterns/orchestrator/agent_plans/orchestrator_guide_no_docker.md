## Introduction
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to designing and implementing an **autonomous AI agent system** using the **Orchestrator-Worker pattern**. This system enables distributed AI agents to handle tasks efficiently, scale dynamically, and operate autonomously.

---

## 1. System Overview

The system consists of:
- **Orchestrator**: Manages task assignments and monitors progress.
- **Worker Agents**: Perform tasks and return results.
- **Message Queue**: Facilitates communication between orchestrator and workers.
- **Persistent Storage**: Stores task data, logs, and results.

### High-Level Architecture

|  Storage / Database |
+----------------------+
```

## 2. Setting Up the Environment

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9+**
- **RabbitMQ (for messaging)**
- **FastAPI / Flask (for API interface)**
- **PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for storage, if needed)**

### Install Required Libraries
```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn pika celery sqlalchemy
```

---

## 3. Implementing the Orchestrator

The **Orchestrator** is responsible for:
- Receiving task requests
- Dispatching tasks to workers
- Monitoring task completion

### Example Orchestrator Implementation (`orchestrator.py`)
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from celery import Celery

app = FastAPI()

celery_app = Celery(
    "tasks",
    broker="pyamqp://guest@localhost//",
    backend="rpc://"
)

@app.post("/submit_task/")
def submit_task(task_data: dict):
    task = celery_app.send_task("worker.process_task", args=[task_data])
    return {"task_id": task.id}
```

---

## 4. Implementing Worker Agents

**Worker Agents**:
- Continuously listen for tasks
- Process tasks independently
- Report results back to the orchestrator

### Example Worker (`worker.py`)
```python
from celery import Celery

celery_app = Celery(
    "tasks",
    broker="pyamqp://guest@localhost//",
    backend="rpc://"
)

@celery_app.task(name="worker.process_task")
def process_task(task_data):
    # Perform AI-related work (e.g., generate code, analyze data)
    result = f"Processed {task_data}"
    return result
```

---

## 5. Implementing a Message Queue

We use **RabbitMQ** to handle messaging between the orchestrator and workers.

### Installing RabbitMQ
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
```

### Enable the RabbitMQ Management Interface
```sh
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```

### Verify RabbitMQ is Running
```sh
systemctl status rabbitmq-server
```

---

## 6. Running the System

### Start the Celery Worker
```sh
celery -A worker worker --loglevel=info
```

### Start the Orchestrator API
```sh
uvicorn orchestrator:app --reload
```

### Submit a Task
```sh
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit_task/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"task": "Generate Code"}'
```

---

## 7. Scaling the System

To scale the system:
- Run multiple worker instances:
  ```sh
  celery -A worker worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=4
  ```
- Use **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring

---

## 8. Conclusion

This guide outlines the fundamental steps to create an **AI Agent System** with an **Orchestrator-Worker** model. The system can be extended by:
- Implementing multiple AI models as different worker types
- Adding logging, authentication, and security measures
- Using distributed computing frameworks like Ray or Dask for advanced workloads
