# BaseServerManager Module Documentation

## Overview
The `BaseServerManager` module provides an abstract class that serves as a blueprint for any server management implementation. It defines methods that need to be implemented for starting, stopping, checking the status, and retrieving error logs for a server.

## Abstract Class: BaseServerManager
### Methods:
- **start_server()**: Must be implemented to start the server.
- **stop_server()**: Must be implemented to stop the server.
- **check_status()**: Must be implemented to check the current status of the server.
- **retrieve_error_logs()**: Must be implemented to retrieve error logs from the server in the event of a failure.

### Dependencies
This module uses the following dependencies:
- `os`: For handling operating system-related functionalities.
- `subprocess`: To execute system commands related to server management.

## Example Implementation
An example implementation of a concrete class `SimpleServerManager` is provided, demonstrating how to start, stop, check server status, and retrieve error logs using `systemctl` and `journalctl` commands.

## Testing
Unit tests are provided using Python's `unittest` framework to ensure that the methods behave as expected and to validate the command invocations.
