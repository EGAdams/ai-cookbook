# Module: UnitTests

## Overview
This module contains unit tests for the functionalities of the server manager classes.
It utilizes the unittest framework to conduct tests on `MySQLServerManager` and `ApacheServerManager`.

## Test Cases

### 1. test_start_server
- **Description**: Test that the MySQL and Apache servers start successfully.
- **Expected Behavior**: The test should assert that the returned value from the start method for both servers is `True`.

### 2. test_stop_server
- **Description**: Test that the MySQL and Apache servers stop successfully.
- **Expected Behavior**: The test should assert that the returned value from the stop method for both servers is `True`.

### 3. test_check_status
- **Description**: Test to check the status of both MySQL and Apache servers.
- **Expected Behavior**: The test should validate that the status is either `running` or `stopped`.

### 4. test_retrieve_error_logs
- **Description**: Test to retrieve error logs for both servers.
- **Expected Behavior**: The test asserts that the error logs returned by both servers are lists.

## Dependencies
- `unittest`: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
- `MySQLServerManager`: Class containing methods to manage the MySQL server.
