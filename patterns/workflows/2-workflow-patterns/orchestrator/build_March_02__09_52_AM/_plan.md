Analyze the following software requirements and design a component structure.

Requirements: Design and implement a Server Manager system that provides functionality to start, stop, and check the status of servers. The system should allow for retrieving server error logs. Create a base ServerManager interface or abstract class that defines these operations. Implement specific managers for MySQL and Apache servers by extending the base ServerManager. Ensure that each server manager correctly handles process management and error retrieval.
Design Constraints: The system should follow SOLID principles to allow easy extension for other server types in the future. Implement the system in Python and ensure it is compatible with Linux-based server environments. Use subprocess or OS-specific commands for starting, stopping, and checking the status of the servers. Provide unit tests to verify the correct functionality of each component.

# System Overview
The Server Manager system is designed to provide a unified interface for managing various server types, focusing initially on MySQL and Apache servers. It allows users to start, stop, and check the status of these servers while also providing access to error logs. The system is implemented using Python, leveraging Linux commands for effective process management. The architecture is designed to be extensible, enabling additional server types to be integrated in the future according to SOLID principles.

# Modules

## BaseServerManager
- Functionality: An abstract class that defines the interface for server management operations like start, stop, check status, and retrieve error logs.
- Interfaces: start_server(), stop_server(), check_status(), retrieve_error_logs()
- Dependencies: os, subprocess


## MySQLServerManager
- Functionality: Concrete implementation of the BaseServerManager for managing MySQL server instances.
- Interfaces: start_server(), stop_server(), check_status(), retrieve_error_logs()
- Dependencies: BaseServerManager, os, subprocess


## ApacheServerManager
- Functionality: Concrete implementation of the BaseServerManager for managing Apache server instances.
- Interfaces: start_server(), stop_server(), check_status(), retrieve_error_logs()
- Dependencies: BaseServerManager, os, subprocess


## UnitTests
- Functionality: A module containing unit tests for verifying the functionality of the server manager classes using a testing framework like unittest or pytest.
- Interfaces: test_start_server(), test_stop_server(), test_check_status(), test_retrieve_error_logs()
- Dependencies: unittest, MySQLServerManager, ApacheServerManager
