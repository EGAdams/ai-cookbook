  "system_overview": "The MySQL Database Manager is a command-line based application that allows users to interact with a MySQL database through a simple menu-driven interface. Users can create, delete, modify, and search for records in the database. The output of the operations is formatted in Markdown and saved to a file called 'output.md', ensuring that the data is easily readable and well-structured. The system is built with a focus on using SOLID principles to ensure maintainability and future extensibility, and it provides robust error handling and input validation to enhance user experience.",
